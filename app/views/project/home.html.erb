<h1>DRP - Mathematics</h1>
<p>
The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students 
with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study 
projects. It runs each semester and during the summer and is 
coordinated by math Ph.D. students. Participation is not for 
credit and does not appear on a student's transcript.
